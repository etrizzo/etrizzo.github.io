                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p class="lead">Hello! Thanks for taking the time to look through my portfolio. As a gameplay programmer, I enjoy working closely with teammates to build robust game systems that enrich player experience. In particular, I like working on systems that make a game feel unique, such as deep systems for generating procedural content, interesting movement systems, or distinctive, programmatic visual effects.</p>
                <p class="lead"> As a programmer, I've found that my role on team projects is often to find ways to enable my teammates to do their work as quickly and effectively as possible. I pride myself on my ability to communicate conditions of satisfaction with my team members, and deliver fast, effective results whether I'm working in Unity, Unreal, or another engine. When I'm working on personal projects, I like to work in my own engine using C++/OpenGL, and I enjoy playing with procedural content generation, including terrain generation, text generation, and generative art. </p>

                <p class="lead"> 
                    So much of my interest in video games is sparked by the child-like wonder I felt growing up just exploring games with my brothers. Whether we were completing a particularly hard level without a strategy guide, or finding an obscure easter egg, or making up fun new ways to exploit mechanics in the game, that sense of discovery is what drove me to play games. I hope to continue to deliver that sense of wonder to players around the world.
                </p>

                    Outside of work, I like to play a wide variety of games from League of Legends to Stardew Valley. Beyond any specific genre, I enjoy games that find ways to feel new and exciting. Some of my favorite games from the past few years are Subnautica, Breath of the Wild, Stardew Valley, Rimworld, The Long Dark, and Celeste. Outside of gaming, I like to spend my free time gardening, making pottery, and hiking around Seattle.
